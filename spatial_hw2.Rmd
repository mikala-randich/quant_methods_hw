# When comparing the coefficients for the species QA that was used to predict DS, the coefficients essentially didn't change when comparing the general linear model, the gls model, and the rational quadratic error model with a nugget. This makes sense because only one species is being used to predict the abundance of another species. 
# The anova comparing the gls model to the rational quadratic error model with a nugget shows that the rational quadratic error model with nugget has a slightly lower AIC value, implying that it may better model the data than the gls model. The very low P-value indicates that there is a significant difference between the models, so we can assume the rational quadratic error model (w/ nugget) is the model that can better explain the spatial data
# When comparing the summaries of the general linear model predicitng DS by one other species, QA, to the rational quadratic error model with a nugget, the AIC value for the rational model was slightly lower than the AIC value for the general linear model. This indicates that taking spatial dependence into consideration slightly improved the model. When comparing the glm and the gls models predicting DS by QA, they had the same AIC and P-values, indicating that the gls didn't do a radically better job of modelling the data.

# For the model that includes multiple species to predict abundance of DS, the coefficients did change between the general linear model and the rational quadratic error model with a nugget. This indicates that accounting for spatial dependence is important when using multiple species to predict the abundance of DS
# When looking at the anova outputs, the AIC value for the rational quadratic error model with a nugget is slightly lower, indicating that it may be a slightly better model for the data than the gls model. Having a non-origin y-intercept by adding the nugget improves the model by allowing for a better fit and a more accurate starting point.
# Adding the spatial error term had more of an impact on model 2 because it includes multiple species as predictor variables, which means more variables are able to display spatial dependence. Since we are addressing species locations and abundance, the majority of the species should have some degree of spacial dependence, so the more species that are included in the model, the larger the influence of spatial depence will be. Model 1 had less of a change when spatial dependence was taken into consideration because only 1 other species was used as a predictive variable.
